This document contains the rationale behind the
schema design.

Table Quiz
A quiz is randomly generated when a user requests
to take a quiz. Due to this, every quiz is unique
and assigned a user. The quiz object will contain
5 easy questions, 3 medium questions, and 2 hard
questions.

Table UserResponse
A question will sometimes be "short answer". In
the case that it is, the response is stored here.
The "answer" will be in the questions associated
Answer.description. It must match exactly to be
correct.

Table User
There will only be one admin and the system will
check the username to see if it is the admin.
We are aware this would never be how user management
is done in the real world.

Table Question
Quizes may have multiple questions. A question will 
contain a difficulty of 1 to 3, 1 being easy and 3 
being hard. The "type" of question will specify to 
the client how to display the question and its
assiocated answers. 

We can hardcode type selections during quiz creation
to make sure there are no discrepancies. 

Table Answer
Questions may have multiple answers and some may or
may not be correct.
